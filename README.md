# Odoo : Javascript Framework Training

This branch contains the exercises and supporting code for the Odoo JavaScript Framework Training.
It provides four addons, each a standalone project that can be completed independently.

To get started:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Check out this branch.
2. Launch an Odoo server with this folder included in the addons path.

Much of the theory is covered in the accompanying slides.
And of courseâ€”feel free to ask questions!
